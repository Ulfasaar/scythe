Feature: file explorer
    The file explorer would allow the user to visualize what files are present
    As a developer
    I want a file explorer so I can interact with my code easily and visualize its structure

    
Given the app is started
Then the file explorer should be shown
And all the files in the directory should be listed
When the app is finished rendering
